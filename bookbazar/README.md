## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended)
- Redis server (Upstash recommended)
- Cloudinary account
- Google Gemini API key

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd bookbazaar
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `bookbazaar/` directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-secret
REDIS_URL=rediss://default:password@your-upstash-host:6379
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

### Generate Prisma client and run migrations

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server |
| `npm run build` | Generate Prisma client and build for production |
| `npm run start` | Run the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

---

## Auth Flow

- Signup and login handled via `app/api/auth/`
- Passwords hashed with `bcryptjs` before storage
- On login, a signed JWT is issued as an HTTP-only session cookie using `jose`
- Middleware checks the session cookie and decodes the role to protect routes
- Redis tracks failed login attempts per email — rate limited to prevent brute-force attacks

---

## Database Schema

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `User` | Buyers, sellers, and admins |
| `Store` | Belongs to a seller, contains book listings |
| `Book` | Belongs to a store, supports soft delete via `isActive` |
| `Category` | Book categories with slug-based upsert |
| `CartItem` | Buyer cart before checkout |
| `Order` | Checkout order with shipping details |
| `OrderItem` | Individual books within an order |

---

## Book Lifecycle

1. Seller creates a book listing with cover image upload
2. Book is stored with `isActive: true`
3. Buyers browse and add books to cart
4. On checkout, an order is created with order items
5. Seller views and updates order status
6. If a seller deletes a book, it is soft-deleted (`isActive: false`) — order history is preserved

---

## Troubleshooting

- If login fails repeatedly, wait 15 minutes for the rate limit to reset
- Ensure `SESSION_SECRET` is set before starting the server
- Confirm `DATABASE_URL` uses a valid PostgreSQL connection string
- Add `res.cloudinary.com` to `remotePatterns` in `next.config.ts` for image rendering
- Vercel deployments require all environment variables set in the Vercel dashboard

---

## Future Improvements

- Payment gateway integration (eSewa, Khalti)
- Book reviews and ratings system
- Seller analytics dashboard
- Email notifications for order updates
- Wishlist and saved books feature
- Advanced search with price range and condition filters
- Mobile app
